There is also a tail coin-emission\n            at the same rate as Monero. Once the offshore part of the protocol\n            is live, the circulating supply will fluctuate due to users minting\n            and burning their funds (XHV to xUSD etc).\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Was Haven an ICO?</Title>\n          <Description>No, there was no ICO.</Description>\n          <Title>So how is it funded?</Title>\n          <Description>\n            Most of the team work on a voluntary basis and receive no payment\n            for their input into the project. However, the developers do receive\n            compensation in the form of XHV due to the large number of hours\n            they give to the project. Funding comes from a 5% governance fee\n            raised from the mining of XHV. It is spent on essential\n            infrastructure for the project, marketing and developer costs.\n          </Description>\n        </Cell>\n        <Heading>Privacy</Heading>\n        <Cell>\n          <Title>How are my funds protected?</Title>\n          <Description>\n            Haven uses the same privacy features as Monero, including: <br />\n            <br />\n            • Ring Signatures <br /> • Ring Confidential transactions (RingCT){\" \"}\n            <br />• Stealth Addresses\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Are the transactions private? </Title>\n          <Description>\n            These features hide the sender, amount and receiver in the\n            transaction. All transactions are private by default and there is no\n            way to accidentally make a transparent transaction. Further\n            information on the privacy features of Haven Protocol can be found\n            in our whitepaper.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Why does Haven need privacy? </Title>\n          <Description>\n            Like any other account there will be sensitive information that a\n            user would not want to be available publicly. This is especially\n            true for personal financial data that, if stolen, can be used by\n            unscrupulous parties to potentially steal those funds. The privacy\n            features of Haven makes this much less likely to happen.\n          </Description>\n          <Important>\n            <Title>Important!</Title>\n            <Description>\n              Although Haven transactions are private and anonymous it should\n              not be used for illicit or illegal purposes that violate a user’s\n              local or national laws.\n            </Description>\n          </Important>\n        </Cell>\n        <Heading>Storing and Using Haven</Heading>\n        <Cell>\n          <Title>Where can I get XHV from? </Title>\n          <Description>\n            Haven (XHV) is available to buy from a number of exchanges or as it\n            is a PoW currency it can also be mined.

You can think of this as a\n            private offshore bank account that only you control. The vaults are\n            available for all major operating systems including Windows, MacOS\n            and Linux as well as Android and Apple mobile devices. There are\n            different options according to your needs:\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Web Vault</Title>\n          <Description>\n            This is the simplest method for those using computers who do not\n            wish to run their own node.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>GUI Vault (Graphical User Interface)</Title>\n          <Description>\n            This is downloaded as an app on your computer and provides a simple\n            to use vault for storing XHV and all Haven xAssets.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>CLI Vault (Command Line Interface)</Title>\n          <Description>\n            This is generally used by those with a greater technical background\n            and a working knowledge of the terminal on their computer.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Mobile Vault</Title>\n          <Description>\n            This is for those who prefer the convenience of keeping their funds\n            stored on a mobile device. The Web Vault is compatible with all\n            mobile devices and native mobile apps will be developed in the\n            future. It is also planned to be able to store your XHV on hardware\n            wallets such as Ledger Nano S.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>I see there are different nodes, what are they?</Title>\n          <Description>\n            A node is basically a computer that connects you to a network. There\n            are generally two different types of node that you can use to\n            connect to the Haven network and each has pros and cons that will be\n            explained below:\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Remote Node</Title>\n          <Description>\n            Remote node is a 3rd party computer that syncs to the network on\n            your behalf. Because you don't need to download and update the chain\n            every time you open the wallet, syncing and updating your balances\n            take a fraction of the time vs a local node. This can be helpful if\n            you have limited storage space on the device you use your wallet\n            with. Choose this if you want to quickly open a wallet and for\n            sending/checking balances and ONLY from trusted providers. There can\n            be risks associated with using a remote node as it increases the\n            chances of somebody being able to identify your IP address to trace\n            transactions from your wallet address. The current list of remote\n            nodes available to users will be on the web.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Local Node</Title>\n          <Description>\n            A local node means that you are using your own computer to connect\n            to the network. With a local node YOU are in control of all the data\n            on the chain and there is less risk of anyone being able to see if\n            you have a wallet open and from what IP. Local nodes are in your\n            control so you don't have to worry about them being down when you\n            want to login to your wallet and move funds around. During major\n            market movements there is a possibility that high traffic volume can\n            cause issues with a remote node leaving you stuck trying to find\n            another one or syncing your own. This will not happen if you use a\n            local node. The drawback to using a local node is that you will have\n            to download and regularly sync (update) the blockchain. This can\n            take some time and will use a significant amount of storage space on\n            your device. It is, however, by far the most secure method of using\n            Haven for longer term wealth storage and is recommended for any\n            significant amounts being stored.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Can I get some help using the wallets?</Title>\n          <Description>\n            Absolutely, there are vault user guides for all vaults on our\n            website. These go through the set-up, use and recovery of vault\n            addresses step by step to enable even non-technical users to be able\n            to take control of their money and be sure it is secure and easily\n            accessible.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Is it safe?</Title>\n          <Description>\n            Your vaults are protected by a password (or seed phrase for Web\n            Vault) that you set and must remember in order to access your funds.\n            During the process of setting up the vault you will also be given a\n            25 word seed phrase. Should you lose your password you can restore\n            your wallet and access your funds using this combination of words.\n            It is essential you keep one or more copies of the seed phrase\n            somewhere safe.\n          </Description>\n          <Important>\n            <Title>Important!</Title>\n            <Description>\n              You are responsible for your funds and no-one else can help you\n              recover them should you lose your password and seed phrase.\n            </Description>\n          </Important>\n          <Title>How can I ‘cash out’ to USD?</Title>\n          <Description>\n            You can cash out to USD or other traditional currency where\n            exchanges have the facility to do so. It is planned to have xUSD etc\n            available on exchanges to make this process simpler.\n          </Description>\n          <Title>Can I send my money to anyone I want? </Title>\n          <Description>\n            Yes, as long as they have a Haven vault then you can send XHV or\n            xAssets to anyone in the world quickly, securely and cheaply.
