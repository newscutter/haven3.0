              Be your own bank with Haven. Simply buy Haven [XHV] from any
              exchange itâ€™s listed on, send it to your own private digital vault
              where you can swap between all supported Haven currencies and
              securely store them without giving up control to anyone else.
              <br />
              <br />
              Complete privacy so that YOUR money is 100% yours. No bank needed.

            <Title>PRIVATE. SECURE. FLEXIBLE.</Title>
            <Description>
              Haven uses an innovative mechanism to swap between all supported
              currencies. For example, when you swap from Haven [XHV] to xUSD
              the system destroys the XHV and creates xUSD equivalent to the USD
              value. If you want to go back to XHV you will always receive the
              same USD worth of XHV.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are many different stablecoin projects but very few that can
              offer the privacy, security and the flexibility of Haven with all
              currency swaps completed in your own Haven vault. No 3rd party
              needed.
